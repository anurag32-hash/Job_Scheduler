# Project Management (Scheduler)

In this part we will use Trie, Red-Black Tree and Priority Queue to implement a Job
scheduler (Project management). The main part of this part are:

```
1 package ProjectManagement;
2 public class Job implements Comparable<Job> {
3 @Override
4 public int compareTo(Job job) {
5 return 0;
6 }
7 }
Listing 13: Job class
```
```
A job can have two status: REQUESTED, COMPLETED.
```
6.1 Specifications

The main component in this part of the assignment is a Job. Each Job will belong to a Project
and created by an User. The name of the Jobs will be unique (this is guaranteed in the test
cases). All the jobs have a running time, i.e. the time required to run this job. The priority of a
job is same as of that its project and a job can only be executed if its running time is less than
the current budget of the Project. Successfully running a Job, will reduce the budget of that
project by running time of the project.

All the projects will be stored in a Trie, using the project name as the key. Project names will
be unique. All the Jobs will be stored in a Priority Queue, specifically a Max-Heap, using
their priorities as the key.


6.2 Commands

A sample input file is shown in Listing 15.

1
USER: Create the user with given user name.
2
PROJECT: Create a project. NAME PRIORITY BUDGET
3
JOB: Create a job. NAME PROJECT USER RUNTIME
4
QUERY: Return the status of the Job queried.
5
ADD: Increase the budget of the project. PROJECT BUDGET
6
EMPTY_LINE: Let the scheduler execute a single JOB.

6.3 Scheduler specifications

The scheduler will execute a single job whenever it will encounter an empty line in the input
specifications. After the end of the INP (input file) file, scheduler will continue to execute
jobs till there are jobs left that can be executed.

Each time the scheduler wants to execute a job, it will do the following:

1
It selects the job with the highest priority from the MAX HEAP.
2
It first check the running time of the Job, say t.
3
It will then fetch the project from the RB-Tree and check its budget, say B.
4
If B â‰¥ t then it executes the job. Executing a job means:

- Set the status of the job to complete.
- Increase the global time by job time.
- Set the completed time of the job as the current global time.
- Decrease the budget of the project by run-time of the job. i.e. = B - t, where
    is the new budget of the project.

5
If: B < t, then select the next job from the max-heap (where jobs are stored) and try to
execute this.
6
A scheduler will return in following cases:

- It successfully executed a single job.
- There are no jobs to be executed.
- None of the jobs can be executed because of the budget issue.


7
After the execution returns, process the next batch of commands (all the commands
till next EMPTY_LINE or EOF).
8
If there are no more commands in the INP (input file) file, then let the scheduler
execute jobs till there are no jobs left, or no jobs can be executed because of budget
issues. This marks the END of the execution.
9
Print the stats of the current system. See Listing 16.

```
package ProjectManagement;
/**
* DO NOT MODIFY
*/
public interface SchedulerInterface {
/**
* @param cmd Handles Project creation. Input is the command from INP1 file in array format (use space to split it)
*/
void handle_project(String[] cmd);
/**
* @param cmd Handles Job creation. Input is the command from INP1 file in array format (use space to split it)
*/
void handle_job(String[] cmd);
/**

*/
void handle_user(String name);
/**
* Returns status of a job
*
* @param key
*/
void handle_query(String key);
/**
* Next cycle, is executed whenever an empty line is found.
*/
void handle_empty_line();
/**
* Executed as a thread to server a job.
*/
void schedule();
/**
* Add budget to a project Input is the command from INP1 file in array format (use space to split it)
*
* @param cmd
*/
void handle_add(String[] cmd);
/**
* If there are no lines in the input commands, but there are jobs which can be executed,let the system run till there are no jobs left (which can be run).
*/
void run_to_completion();
/**
* After execution is done, print the stats of teh system
*/
void print_stats();
